        Welcome to our e-commerce store! We are dedicated to providing you with
        the best products and customer service. Our goal is to offer a seamless
        shopping experience with a wide range of high-quality products. But I
        must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
        and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the
        system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
        truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
        or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who
        do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
        that are extremely painful.
